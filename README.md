# Java Coding Demo

This is a simple demo that includes two separate tasks.

## Open Closed Principle using Springboot

This task demonstrates the _**Open Closed Principle**_ using the Spring Boot framework. The Open Closed Principle is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming, which states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Regarding this project, when adding a new Pay mode, for example` E-pay`,  could just adding `Epay.class` in `com.example.demo.OpenClosedPrinciple.variousPay` package, just like `Cash.class`, without changing any other classes.

To run this task, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 18 or higher and Maven installed on your machine. You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website and install Maven from the Apache Maven website.

Once you have the JDK and Maven installed, you can download the source code from this repository and run the application by starting `com.example.demo.StartApplication.java`.

## Poker Game Winning Algorithm

This task demonstrates how to identify if a player wins when given 12 cards in a poker game. 
The main class for this task is `com.example.demo.pokerGame.WinningAlgorithm`, in which using _**recursive algorithm**_ to do this task.

Running _`com.example.demo.pokerGame.WinningAlgorithmTest.java`_ to demonstrate several  scenarios.
